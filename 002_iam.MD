# Identity and Access Management
A default root account is created.  Shouldn't be used or shared.   
Put users in Groups and apply ```least privilege``` principle.    
Groups cannot be nested, but users can belong to different groups     
Users DO NOT have to belong to a group

IAM Policy
Users or Groups can be assigned a JSON policy.  This is an admin user. They can perform all actions and have access to all resources
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Creating the first user.  We don't want to use the root user.  Best practice is to create a new user, then create and add them to an admins group, granting them AdministratorAccess     
Select AWS Management Console access.  This will allow the user to sign in.  You can either auto generate a password, or create one.  Moreover, require the user to reset the password over a given period of time.

# IAM

## Basic layout
1. Root user - Avoid using. Make a new user and put in Admin group that has an admin policy.
2. Users 
3. Groups - Users are put into groups and least privilege permissions are assigned via a JSON policy. 

** Users can be in multiple groups, but groups cannot be nested into groups

## Create a new User
1. IAM > Users > Add User > input user name > next > add member to group > create
2. In most instances you'll add a user to a Group.  If they need acces to the Console, you have to enable console access and fill out the additional information.

## IAM Permissions
1. users or groups have an assigned JSON policy document attatched.

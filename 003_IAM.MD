# IAM

## Basic layout
1. Root user - Avoid using. Make a new user and put in Admin group that has an admin policy.
2. Users 
3. Groups - Users are put into groups and least privilege permissions are assigned via a JSON policy. 

** Users can be in multiple groups, but groups cannot be nested into groups

## Create a new User
1. IAM > Users > Add User > input user name > next > add member to group > create
2. In most instances you'll add a user to a Group.  If they need acces to the Console, you have to enable console access and fill out the additional information.

## IAM Permissions
1. users or groups have an assigned JSON policy document attatched. 
2. Follow the ```least privilege principal```.  Only what the user needs.

3. IAM > Access management > Policies. These are policies created by and managed by AWS.  This is where we can view all of the services tied to each policy.
4. You can also create your own policy.  IAM > Access management > Policies > Create policy. You can either use the visual editor or write one from scratch using JSON.

## Password Policy and Multi Factor Authorization
1. IAM > Access management > Account settings > Password policy.  IAM has a default covering min length, upper/lower case ltrs, numbers, expiration time, password reuse.  OR..you can set these yourself.
2. MFA. Additional authorization is sent to a device you own.  Options: MFA device like Google authenticator, Authy (can be used on multiple devices), a UTF third party physical device or a key fob.
3. MFA for root account should be done. 
4. Setup MFA. Go to name in top right hand corner > drop down > Security credentials > MFA.  Select from Authenticator App (authy), Security Key (USB device), Hardware TOTP token (stand alone device).

## How users can access AWS
1. AWS management console (protected by password and MFA)
2. AWS command line interface (CLI) (protected by access keys)
3. AWS software developer kit (SDK) (for code: protected by access keys)
    * Access Keys are generated through the AWS console.
    * Users manage their own keys
    * Keys are secrete.  Don't share them.
    * Install AWS CLI on Mac
    * In

# IAM

## Basic layout
1. Root user - Avoid using. Make a new user and put in Admin group that has an admin policy.
2. Users 
3. Groups - Users are put into groups and least privilege permissions are assigned via a JSON policy. 

** Users can be in multiple groups, but groups cannot be nested into groups

## Create a new User
1. IAM > Users > Add User > input user name > next > add member to group > create
2. In most instances you'll add a user to a Group.  If they need acces to the Console, you have to enable console access and fill out the additional information.

## IAM Permissions
1. users or groups have an assigned JSON policy document attatched. 
2. Follow the ```least privilege principal```.  Only what the user needs.

3. IAM > Access management > Policies. These are policies created by and managed by AWS.  This is where we can view all of the services tied to each policy.
4. You can also create your own policy.  IAM > Access management > Policies > Create policy. You can either use the visual editor or write one from scratch using JSON.
